# NFT Marketplace DApp

Welcome to the NFT Marketplace DApp repository! This is a React-based decentralized application (DApp) designed for the creation, deployment, and trading of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The purpose of this project is to facilitate the seamless exchange of NFTs within the blockchain ecosystem.

## Project Overview

This application serves as an NFT marketplace where users can perform the following actions:

- **Upload and Deploy NFTs:** Users can upload their unique digital assets and deploy them as NFTs on the Sepolia network.

- **Purchase NFTs:** Individuals can explore listed NFTs and make purchases within the platform.
- **View Listed NFTs:** A comprehensive display of all listed NFTs available for sale within the marketplace.
- **Sell Owned NFTs:** Users who possess NFTs in their wallets can list them for sale within the marketplace.


## Technologies Used

- **React.js** is employed to build the user interface for seamless interaction with the NFT marketplace.

- **Hardhat** is utilized to deploy smart contracts on the Sepolia network, enabling the creation and management of NFTs.

- **Ether.js** library is used to facilitate interactions between the frontend and the deployed smart contracts.

- **Moralis** API is integrated to enhance functionalities related with retrieval of NFT-related data.
